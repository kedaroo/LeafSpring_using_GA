# LeafSpring_using_GA
Genetic algorithm is use for the purpose of constrained design optimization of multileaf spring. Genetic algorithms are inspired from nature. They mimic the natural 
biological operators of nature such as selection, cross – over and mutation. Selection 
here refers to the selection of the fittest individual from a gene – pool. These fittest 
individuals are crossed – over to form the next generation of species. The next 
generation naturally inherits the fitness – defining characteristics of their parents. At 
the same time, due to mutation, they create their own unique characteristics. This 
process repeats over several generations and each generation is fitter than the previous 
one. This idea is used to optimize the design of leaf spring. The objective function in 
this case in stress minimization.
